# Variant Nim 
Implementation of **variant of the game of Nim** in Haskell. Two players then take it in turn to remove one or more stars from the end of a single row. The winner is the player who makes the board empty.


### Standard Nim 
A standard Nim game is played on a board comprising five rows with each row consisting of certain number of stars.

```
1: "* * * * *"

2: "* * * *"

3: "* * *"

4: "* *"

5: "*"

```

### Variant of the Game of Nim

In the **variant version**, we construct the Nim board with arbitrary number of rows as per the players choice. Two players agree on the number of rows (minimum of 5 rows) before starting the game.



### Play Nim

To start the game, execute the following command 

```
cabal run
```
